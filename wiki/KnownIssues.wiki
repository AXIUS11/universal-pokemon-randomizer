#summary Bugs or oddities with the current release of the randomizer.

= General =
  * The randomiser may not function at all on Windows systems with certain custom themes installed.

= General Gameboy Games =
  * Nothing right now.

= Generation One Games =
  * Nothing right now.

= Generation Two Games =
  * Nothing right now.

= Generation Three Games =
  * Nothing right now.

= General DS Games =
  * The sprites, names or cries of the starter Pokemon shown when you pick one may not be updated when they are randomized or manually set in the randomizer. This is due to a lack of knowledge on appropriate code offsets etc and not a bug.
  * For all DS games except Black2/White2, Pokedex Area data is not updated when you randomize Wild Pokemon. This should eventually be fixed for Black/White 1 but it is unlikely to be fixed for Generation 4 games.


= Generation Four Games =
  * (1.5.0/1.6.0/1.6.0a) Support for non-English Generation 4 games is broken quite badly, though they should still work if you avoid options such as Ingame Trades and Move Tutors.

= Generation Five Games =
  * A battle with Zinzolin isn't consistent with his other battles.
  * At least in Black 2/White 2, Habitat List is not updated if you randomize Wild Pokemon. For now, this cannot be fixed.
